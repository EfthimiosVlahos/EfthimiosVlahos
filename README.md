  My name is <b>Efthimios Vlahos</b>.<br/>

Data Scientist with a strong educational background and extensive research anything to do with Data Science. I recently completed my graduate studies at SUNY Stony Brook University, where I earned a degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. Prior to that, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Physics & Mathematics, further solidifying my foundation in quantitative disciplines.

My expertise spans over five years of hands-on experience in Python and SQL, which I have effectively utilized to analyze and manipulate large datasets. I have also honed my skills in data visualization through over two years of practical experience in Power BI, as well as one year of proficiency in Tableau, enabling me to create impactful and visually appealing data presentations.

In addition to my programming and visualization abilities, I possess over one year of experience working with Hadoop and PySpark, demonstrating my proficiency in handling and processing large-scale data sets. Moreover, my knowledge extends to advanced machine learning models, as I have a deep understanding of Python's scikit-learn library and possess expertise in leveraging deep learning frameworks to develop sophisticated predictive models.

Core skills:
Python, R, C++, SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Power BI, Tableau TensorFlow, Machine Learning, Statistics, Mathematics, Data Analysis, Data Wrangling, Data Engineering
